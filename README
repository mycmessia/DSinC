This is a project about the solutions of book
《Fundamentals of Data Structures in C》written by myc, 
so there must be some solutions which aren't good enough, even have bugs. 
If you want to help this project be better, 
please contact me by mycmessia@qq.com || mycmessia@gmail.com, thanks.

Coding Style and some tips:

1. Write a Makefile unless the project only has one file,
   when the project has a Makefile, you can input ./make to get the *.out
   or you can input gcc *.c -o *.out.

2. If the message of print function is a complete sentence, please make
   sure it is end with a '.'.
